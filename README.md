# sos-som
Train Self-Organizing Maps, compute quality measures and visualize them. The documentation of the package can be found
[here](https://sos-som.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?).

The "sos" in sos-som is not a cry for help, but a shorthand for the course "Self-Organizing Systems" at TU Wien. 

## Installation

tbd

### Implemented Features
- Maps:
    - Architectures:
        - Standard SOM with online learning algorithm (hexagonal or rectangular unit neighborhood)
